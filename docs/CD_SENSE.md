# CD error recovery and REQUEST SENSE

The CD transport implements the NEC six-byte REQUEST SENSE command (`$03`)
through its existing bounded DATA IN handshake. It returns an actual error
response, rather than treating the command as successful without data.
Successful READ cadence, the selected Gear-style status/message handshake,
unknown-command policy and CDDA playback profile remain separate contracts.

## Fixed response and lifetime

The selected NEC response always contains **18 bytes**, including when CDB
allocation byte 4 is zero, smaller than 18 or larger than 18. This follows
the independently executed Beetle implementation; it is not a general SCSI
allocation-length promise. All bytes start zero, with these fields:

| Byte | Value |
|---|---|
| 0 | `$70`, current error with no valid information field |
| 2 | Pending sense key |
| 7 | `$0A`, additional length |
| 12 | Additional sense code (ASC) |
| 13 | ASC qualifier |
| 14 | Field-replaceable-unit value, currently zero |

REQUEST SENSE works without a TOC or provider. It snapshots the pending
context into the response and clears that context **when the complete CDB
is dispatched**, including when the subsequent transfer is aborted. A second
request returns the no-error response. Successful unrelated commands preserve
an outstanding context; a later error replaces it. Warm SCSI reset preserves
the pending context, while cold `CdControl` initialization clears it.

The first byte settles through the aggregate DATA IN handshake without a
new scheduled drive delay. Subsequent bytes retain the selected transport's
900-master-tick short-response pacing, 21-tick automatic ACK and existing
status/message completion. Beetle enters DATA IN before its next service pass
asserts the first REQ. These are functional response/lifecycle comparisons,
not electrical phase or exact transport timing parity.

## Recoverable media outcomes

Only explicit `SectorReadError` outcomes are converted to guest CHECK
CONDITION. They carry a typed reason and the requested LBA. The following
bounded mappings are implemented:

| Outcome | Key / ASC / ASCQ |
|---|---|
| Missing TOC for an existing directory/audio command | `$02 / $0B / $00` |
| Starting READ outside the volume or crossing leadout | `$05 / $25 / $00` |
| Starting READ on an audio track, or provider rejects non-data | `$03 / $1D / $00` |
| Explicit unavailable data payload or unsupported gap read | `$05 / $00 / $00` |
| Validated malformed MODE1 raw header | `$03 / $11 / $05` |

Starting READ uses the attached TOC's track classification. Later sector
classification belongs to the provider. A mid-stream audio/gap rejection is
an explicit provider policy; it is not a claim of exact Beetle raw-sector
validation behavior across a track boundary. No ECC/EDC repair or physical
media-error model is introduced.

The toolkit rejects a starting LBA at or beyond leadout. Pinned Beetle's
starting READ check uses `>` rather than `>=`; exactly at leadout it can instead
classify the leadout TOC entry as non-data. The finite independent vector uses
LBA 25 on a 20-sector volume, plus a read from 19 crossing leadout. Exact
starting-at-leadout equivalence is not claimed.

A failed sector is never partially published. The transport cancels remaining
loads and presents CHECK CONDITION; a subsequent command can request sense
and retry an independently valid read. CHD caches invalidate their previous
hunk identity before decoding, so a failed decoder that overwrites its output
cannot leave that memory mislabeled as an older successful hunk.

Source identity changes, missing/unsupported configuration, host open or short
reads, unknown decoder failures and malformed provider error contracts remain
terminal `Fault` outcomes. They do not become a plausible guest media error.
Built-in provider identity guards run before recoverable classification and are checked
again before a typed error escapes. Missing READ providers remain configuration
faults, including TOC-only recipes; metadata never fabricates readable media.

## Inspection, ABI and reference boundaries

After a sense request or latched error, paused `status.host` and final runner
JSON include `cd_sense` with `commands`, `errors` and `pending`. The pending
object contains `key`, `asc`, `ascq`, `fru` and nullable `failed_lba`.
These diagnostics do not acknowledge, clear or clock the device. Failure LBAs
are host diagnostics only; guest response bytes 3..6 remain zero with no valid
information bit. Runs with no sense/error activity retain their previous
metadata shape.

Runtime ABI **22** adds the pending context and counters. Re-emit retained
ABI-12 through ABI-21 captures with their original labels, then rebuild the
module and runtime together. No serialized state format is added. Future
states must preserve the pending context separately from the active response
snapshot, CDB/data position, ACK and scheduled transitions.

Geargrafx supplies a delayed GOOD-only REQUEST SENSE shortcut with no payload.
This implementation deliberately differs. Beetle supplies the independently
executed payload/lifecycle reference. Its error status byte is `$01`; the
toolkit retains the existing Gear-style `$02` status/message encoding.
Comparisons distinguish status classes and sense payload from raw wire
agreement. See [REFERENCE.md](REFERENCE.md) and [STATUS.md](STATUS.md) for
the actual compiled adapters, checks and limits. No hardware, complete CD
protocol or campaign compatibility is certified by this finite scope.
